# Expo Go: Cryptic Errors Due to SDK Version Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common but often difficult-to-diagnose issue in Expo projects: cryptic errors caused by a mismatch between the Expo Go app's SDK version and the SDK version specified in your project's `app.json` or `expo.json` file.

## Problem

When developing with Expo, you might encounter unexpected crashes or behavior without clear error messages.  This is frequently due to using newer Expo SDK features (like a new API or component) in your project that the Expo Go app on your device doesn't support. The error may manifest as seemingly random errors, making debugging challenging.

## Solution

Ensure the Expo Go app installed on your device is updated to a version compatible with the SDK version used in your project.  You can check the Expo Go app's version in the app's settings.  If it's outdated, update the Expo Go app from your device's app store. Alternatively, use Expo Client to run your app.
