This error typically occurs when you have a mismatch between the Expo Go app version and the SDK version of your Expo project.  The error message itself might not be explicit, but the underlying cause is that Expo Go can't handle features or APIs introduced in newer SDK versions.

Example:
You're using Expo SDK 48 features in your project, but the Expo Go app on your device only supports up to SDK 46. This would lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, potentially manifesting as a seemingly random or unclear error.
